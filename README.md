# opsgenie-logdl
Script for finding and downloading opsgenie log entries.  As of 20 Feb 2021, this is very basic but I could see lots and lots of functionality being added.  This is more a POC than anything, and I may occasionally use it but it's not necessarily too useful at present.

Functionality I can envision adding:
  - Automatic conversion of local to GMT
  - Options to draw out certain info from downloaded entries, like (if applicable) message + uniqueAlertID, email body etc
  - getopts for help and other options
